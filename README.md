# E-Signature App 

This is a simple React demo app for an E-Signature application with user input.

## Features

- User can enter their username and age
- Form validates:
  - Username is required
  - Age must be > 18
- On valid input, displays user information
- Implements simple "E-Signature" by displaying username

## Usage

The app contains a form with:

- Username input 
- Age input
- Submit button

Once valid info is submitted, user details are displayed including username as "signature".

## Running the App

The app requires Node.js to be installed.

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` 
4. Access via http://localhost:3000

This demonstrates React form handling, validation, and conditional rendering.

## Next Steps

Future iterations could:

- Connect to backend to save E-Signature 
- Add additional form fields like email, password etc.
- Improve input validation
- Add UI/UX enhancements
